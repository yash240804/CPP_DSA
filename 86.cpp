/*
vec can be a vectors or array
vec.begin() to get the memory address of first element of array
vec.end() to get the memory address of last element of array
sort() to sort a array (Ex: sort(vec.begin(), vec.end()))
vec.insert() to insert in a array
vec.size() to get the size of array or vector
vec.push_back() to insert in vector from back or end
vec.pop_back() to delete in vector from back or end
auto / std::vector<int>::iterator - uto automatically deduces the correct type of the iterator when you assign the result of nums.begin() or nums.end() to a variable. In the case of a std::vector<int>, the type deduced will be something like std::vector<int>::iterator
